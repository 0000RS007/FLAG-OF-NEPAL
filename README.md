# FLAG-OF-NEPAL
I animated world's only non-quadrilateral national flag, flag of my country Nepal.

*I have used:
 rt for right,
 lt for left,
 fd for forward,
 for backward, back,
just to save time you could also use: 
 right for rt,
 left for lt,
 forward for fd,
 back,backward for bd,
without an error.

*I have used hex color code for more clarity of nepal flag,you could simply use general names of color too.

*I have tried to make it easy to understand for all using comment lines.
Hope you will like it and be more patriotic towards the nation.
Thank you!!
